Being able to go on the feild trip to rackspace was super duper awesome,
to see what goes on in that world wide known company.But I realized that I am no where near close to being quailfied for a job there. Technology is pretty
dang amazing and so is that place, but it is not for me at all because half the time I was very lost by that lauguage.
