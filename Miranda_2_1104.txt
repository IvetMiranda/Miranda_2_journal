I am a hardworker but I don't think I could ever be a person who would 
spend hours with Linux and netowrking, it's just another completly different 
language to me that I know I cannot understand. 
I am also more of a person who works better in a group, and depending on the 
situation I am good at independent problem solving. Mainly because I like to 
know who other ideas and to make sure I'm doing the problem right. 
I need to kpartx the disk and tell it where to go.
