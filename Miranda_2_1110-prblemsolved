I'm not sure how to recover a deleted file, i was hoping to learn but I
guess i'm just going to have to ask my classmates next to me for help cause
they're bettter teachers. 

I don't know any programs to be used, all I know is linux, but I know 
this has nothing to do with recovering deleted files. 

I need to know a lot of information to recover these files, but I have no idea 
what to do though.
