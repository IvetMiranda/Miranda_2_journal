The process for locating the beginning of an image is:
1) Find the start of the JPEG (xxd and grep)
2) Find the end of the JPEG (xxd and grep)
3) Calculate the size of the JPEG (in bytes using bc)
4) Cut from the staert to the end and output to a file (using dd) 


First we search for the start of the JPEG(header). We search fo search for its header by using the comman xxd. 
Then we grep to find the line.
Using the value from that - we use echo andbc to conver hexideciaml to a decimal number.
For example, in the example from yesterday, we foun jpeg header  and converted it to decimal using the command "ibase=16;00052A0" | bc
Then to find the end of the file, we searched for
******************************************************
Using that information, we find the number of bits, using the command echo "ibase=16;0006C74" | bc
Then using dd we can reconstruct the file using the command xxd -s 21156 image_carve.raw | grep ffd9
